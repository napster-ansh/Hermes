# Hermes
What is Hermes?
Crime Reporting is a long, tiresome and a  tedious process. 
We have to go to Police Stations and then wait for hours before we can even lodge our complaints. We also have to keep going there to keep track of our complaint.
So, this way we end up wasting hours for any outcome.
We believe that we can not only make this time consuming process shorter but also more efficient than the current system.
To file any complaint, users would have to register themselves into the system. They would have to give all of their personal details along with some identity proofs which would be verified by officials.
Hermes also allows users to check recent crimes that have happened near them. They can also check data and figures that have been published by the police.
We have even proposed a database which includes all the criminal records. This would increase the transparency in the system
